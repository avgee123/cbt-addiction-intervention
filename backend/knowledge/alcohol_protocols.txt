ALCOHOL RELAPSE PREVENTION PROTOCOL (CBT-BASED)

CORE OBJECTIVE: 
Manage the emotional "weight" and the desire for escape/numbness. Alcohol cravings often stem from emotional dysregulation.

PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS:
1. Validation: Use 'validation_alc' to acknowledge the "heavy" feeling or the need to escape. Validate that alcohol is a depressant that increases anxiety the next day.
2. Shock Response: Use 'ice_sensation' (Cold Water/Ice) to trigger the Mammalian Dive Reflex. This is the fastest way to lower heart rate and snap out of an emotional spiral.
3. Body Awareness: Use 'body_scan_alc' to identify where the user is holding tension (jaw, chest, shoulders) and release it.
4. Anchoring: Use 'anchor_grounding' to focus on heavy physical objects. This counters the "blur" or "lightheadedness" associated with alcohol cravings.
5. Cognitive Reinforcement: Use 'power_affirmation' to build self-efficacy. Remind the user they are choosing clarity over temporary numbness.

AI GUIDELINES:
- If user looks "Sad" or "Numb", prioritize 'body_scan_alc' and 'power_affirmation'.
- If user looks "Frustrated" or "Aggressive", prioritize 'ice_sensation'.
