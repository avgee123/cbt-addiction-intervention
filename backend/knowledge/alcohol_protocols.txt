PROTOCOL: Alcohol Use Disorder Intervention (CBT-Based)
CORE FOCUS: Stimulus Control and Hydration-Reset.

SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT: Alcohol urges are often tied to emotional regulation deficits. CBT focuses on "HALT" (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) triggers.

THERAPEUTIC STEPS:
1. STIMULUS CONTROL: Immediately remove alcohol from sight/environment.
2. SOMATIC GROUNDING: Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique to reconnect with the present moment and reduce impulsivity.
3. COGNITIVE CHALLENGE: Play the tape to the end. Don't just think about the first drink; visualize the hangover, the regret, and the lost progress.
4. BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION: Engage in a high-sensory task (like splashing cold water on the face) to break the "craving loop."
5. HYDRATION: Drink two glasses of cold water to simulate the ritual of drinking while cleansing the palate.
