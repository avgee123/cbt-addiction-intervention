PROTOCOL: Substance Abuse & Heavy Urge Management (CBT-Based)
CORE FOCUS: Safety Planning and Sensory Grounding.

SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT: High-intensity cravings for substances can cause "tunnel vision." The priority is physical safety and immediate sensory interruption.

THERAPEUTIC STEPS:
1. ENVIRONMENT RESET: Move to a "Neutral Zone." If indoors, go outdoors; if seated, stand up.
2. BOX BREATHING: Inhale 4s, Hold 4s, Exhale 4s, Hold 4s. This down-regulates the fight-or-flight response.
3. URGE SURFING: Visualize the urge as an ocean wave. You are the surfer. The wave is big, but it will eventually break and wash away. You don't have to fight the wave; you just have to stay on the board.
4. EMERGENCY COGNITIVE TASK: Count backward from 100 by 7s. This forces the prefrontal cortex (rational brain) to override the limbic system (impulsive brain).
5. AFFIRMATION: "This feeling is temporary. I have survived 100% of my worst days so far."
