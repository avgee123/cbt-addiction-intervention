SUBSTANCE/DRUGS RELAPSE PREVENTION PROTOCOL (CBT-BASED)

CORE OBJECTIVE: 
De-escalate intense physical cravings and intrusive thoughts. Focus on high-intensity grounding and safety.

PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS:
1. Validation: Use 'validation_drugs' to identify the intensity of the urge. Acknowledge that the brain is currently "misfiring" and needs a reset.
2. High-Intensity Breathing: Use 'breath_intro' and 'inhale_exhale' to re-oxygenate the brain and provide a sense of physical control.
3. Resistance Training: Use 'grip_reality' (pressing palms against a wall). This uses large muscle groups to discharge excess nervous energy.
4. Auditory/Tactile Shock: Use 'sensory_shock' (clapping/rubbing hands) to break the cycle of obsessive "tunnel vision" toward the drug.
5. Emergency Logic: Use 'logic_emergency' to play the tape until the end—focusing on the legal, health, and personal chaos caused by a relapse.
6. Internal Shielding: Use 'internal_anchor' to build a mental barrier against the craving.

AI GUIDELINES:
- If user looks "Paranoid" or "Extremely Restless", prioritize 'grip_reality' and 'sensory_shock'.
- If user looks "Withdrawn", prioritize 'breath_intro' and 'logic_emergency'.
