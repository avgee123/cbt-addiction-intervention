NICOTINE RELAPSE PREVENTION PROTOCOL (CBT-BASED)

CORE OBJECTIVE: 
Intercept nicotine cravings during their 3-5 minute peak using Urge Surfing and Sensory Grounding.

PSYCHOLOGICAL STEPS:
1. Validation: Acknowledge that nicotine withdrawal causes chemical anxiety. This is not a personal failure, but a brain reset.
2. Physiological De-escalation: Use 'breath_intro' and 'inhale_exhale' to lower the heart rate. Nicotine addicts often have shallow breathing during cravings.
3. Oral Fixation Replacement: Use 'sip_water' to simulate the throat hit sensation and hydrate the body.
4. Physical Discharge: Use 'clench_fists' to release accumulated cortisol and aggressive energy.
5. Sensory Redirection: Use 'sensory_nic_blue_object' and 'sensory_nic_textured_object' to move brain activity from the amygdala (emotional craving) to the prefrontal cortex (rational observation).
6. Cognitive Reframing: Use 'nicotine_logic' to remind the user that smoking one cigarette only restarts the withdrawal clock, it doesn't end it.
7. Future Self: Use 'future_self' to anchor the user to a long-term goal of clean lungs and freedom.

GUIDELINES FOR AI ANALYSIS:
If the user shows "Restlessness" (shifting eyes, touching face/neck), prioritize Sensory Grounding. 
If the user shows "High Anxiety" (fast breathing, trembling voice), prioritize Breathing protocols.
