PROTOCOL: Nicotine Addiction Recovery (CBT-Based)
CORE FOCUS: Urge Surfing and Cognitive Restructuring.

SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT: Nicotine cravings usually peak within 5-10 minutes. The goal is to "ride out" the wave without acting on it.

THERAPEUTIC STEPS:
1. FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS: Identify triggers (e.g., morning coffee, stress, social circles).
2. THE 4D STRATEGY: 
   - Delay: Wait 10 minutes (the craving will subside).
   - Deep Breath: Reset the nervous system.
   - Drink Water: Oral fixation replacement.
   - Do something else: Cognitive distraction.
3. COGNITIVE REFRAMING: Shift from "I need a cigarette to relax" to "Nicotine creates the stress it claims to solve; breathing is what actually relaxes me."
4. PHYSICAL RELEASE: Focus on shoulder and jaw tension (common nicotine withdrawal spots).
