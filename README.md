# LAST.CALL 📱
**Breaking the cycle of addiction with Real-Time Multimodal AI.**

## 🌟 Overview
LAST.CALL is a digital intervention tool designed to stop relapses at the moment of crisis. By analyzing physical biomarkers of distress and anxiety in real-time, we provide immediate, science-backed CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) support when users are most vulnerable.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **AI Core:** Gemini 3 Flash Multimodal API (Real-time analysis of video and audio check-ins)
- **Voice Synthesis:** ElevenLabs (Empathetic Voice Agents for human-like intervention)
- **Backend:** FastAPI & MongoDB Atlas
- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Development:** GitHub Copilot for rapid UI prototyping and backend debugging.

## 🧠 Scientific Foundation
- **Biomarker Detection:** Utilizing clinical research on vocal tremors and facial micro-expressions (Action Units) as high-accuracy indicators of acute psychological distress (Scherer et al.).
- **JITAI Principles:** Implementing *Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions* to catch the "craving window" before a relapse occurs.
- **CBT Grounding:** Leveraging auditory-guided grounding techniques to reduce autonomic nervous system arousal during a crisis.

## 🔒 Privacy by Design
User safety is our priority. All video and audio data is processed through the Gemini File API's temporary buffer and is automatically purged within 48 hours. We do not store permanent video recordings on our servers, ensuring a secure and private experience for all users.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **15-Second Check-in:** The user records a short video describing their current state.
2. **Multimodal Analysis:** Gemini 2.5 Flash detects micro-expressions of anxiety and vocal instability.
3. **Instant Intervention:** If a crisis is detected, an ElevenLabs voice agent provides a calm, guided CBT session to help the user stay grounded.
